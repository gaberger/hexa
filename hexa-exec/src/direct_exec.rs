//! Minimal "cut the pipeline" executor — ADR-2026-06-04-1740 Path A.
//!
//! The whole factory's doing-path (org_responder → SOP phases → personas →
//! twin approval → commitments → 4 duplicate reason loops → conductor) is, for
//! execution, accidental complexity: ~10 independently-failing stages
//! coordinating through mutable STDB claims/leases. Across two sessions it never
//! autonomously produced a working composed artifact.
//!
//! This is the irreducible loop that actually ships code:
//!
//!   task {instruction, file, evidence} →
//!     read the file (deterministic, NO model-driven exploration) →
//!     ONE inference call asking for a precise {mode, old_string, new_string} edit →
//!     apply the edit → run the evidence command (must exit 0) →
//!     pass → commit.  fail → feed the error + current content back, retry (≤ max).
//!     still failing → return failed (visible, not a silent escalation).
//!
//! No personas. No board. No twin. No commitments. No claims. The
//! over-exploration failure can't occur: the file is pre-grounded and there are
//! no exploration tools to loop on.
