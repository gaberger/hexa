//! Per-run git-worktree isolation for the autonomous executor (ADR-2606071323).
//!
//! The single-agent executor commits — and may roll back — on every run. Doing
//! that on the operator's checked-out branch is a data-loss race: incident
//! 2026-06-07, an autonomous rollback `git reset` dropped an operator commit
//! (`e8437655`) as collateral. This module confines each *isolated* run to a
//! dedicated worktree on a `hexa/auto/<slug>` branch, created as a SIBLING of the
//! repo so it never even appears in the operator's `git status`. Commit,
//! evidence, and any rollback are scoped to that worktree; results flow back via
//! `hexa worktree merge` (ADR-2026-04-13-1930), never a raw reset on the shared root.
//!
//! Isolation is the default. Only the interactive operator path (`hexa do`, which
//! sends `isolate:false`) commits directly on its own branch — that tree is the
//! operator's to manage (ADR-2606071323 scope).
