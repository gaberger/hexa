//! Optional LLM-driven semantic edge inference.
//!
//! The engine stays network-free: instead of calling an LLM directly, it accepts
//! a `SemanticExtractor`. AST-only ("ast" mode) builds pass `NoopSemanticExtractor`;
//! "deep" mode passes an implementation that calls hexa's inference path (wired in
//! hexa-nexus). This keeps the engine deterministic and unit-testable.
