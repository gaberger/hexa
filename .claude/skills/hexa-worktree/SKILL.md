# Hex Worktree — Git Worktree Lifecycle for Hex Features

In hexa architecture, each adapter boundary gets its own git worktree during feature development. This skill manages the full worktree lifecycle: creation, status tracking, merge ordering, and cleanup.

## Why Worktrees?

Hexagonal architecture enforces strict import boundaries between layers. By giving each adapter its own worktree, hexa ensures:
- Adapters cannot accidentally import each other (they're in separate directories)
- Parallel development — multiple agents can code different adapters simultaneously
- Clean merge ordering — domain/ports merge first, then adapters, then integration

## Parameters

Ask the user for:
- **action** (required): One of: setup, status, merge, cleanup, list, stale
- **feature_name** (required for setup/status/merge/cleanup): The feature identifier
- **skip_specs** (optional, default: false): Bypass specs requirement (emergency hotfixes only)

## Action: setup

Create worktrees from an existing workplan.

### Prerequisites
1. Behavioral specs must exist at `docs/specs/<feature-name>.json` (enforced by hexa-specs-required hook)
2. Workplan must exist at `docs/workplans/feat-<feature-name>.json`

### Steps

1. Read the workplan:
```bash
cat docs/workplans/feat-<feature-name>.json
```

2. For each step in the workplan, create a worktree:
```bash
# Domain/ports changes (Tier 0)
git worktree add ../hexa-feat-<feature>-domain feat/<feature>/domain
git worktree add ../hexa-feat-<feature>-ports feat/<feature>/ports

# Secondary adapters (Tier 1)
git worktree add ../hexa-feat-<feature>-<adapter> feat/<feature>/<adapter>

# Primary adapters (Tier 2)
git worktree add ../hexa-feat-<feature>-<adapter> feat/<feature>/<adapter>

# Integration (Tier 5)
git worktree add ../hexa-feat-<feature>-integration feat/<feature>/integration
```

3. Register worktrees in HexFlo memory:
```tool
mcp__hex__hex_hexflo_memory_store({
  key: "feature/<feature>/worktrees",
  value: {
    feature: "<feature>",
    worktrees: [
      { branch: "feat/<feature>/domain", path: "../hexa-feat-<feature>-domain", tier: 0, status: "active" },
      ...
    ],
    created_at: "ISO timestamp"
  }
})
```

4. If `scripts/feature-workflow.sh` exists, prefer using it:
```bash
./scripts/feature-workflow.sh setup <feature-name>
```

## Action: status

Show the current state of all worktrees for a feature.

### Steps

1. List all worktrees:
```bash
git worktree list
```

2. Filter to the feature's worktrees (branches matching `feat/<feature>/`)

3. For each worktree, report:
   - Branch name and path
   - Tier (from workplan)
   - Commits ahead of main: `git log main..feat/<feature>/<adapter> --oneline`
   - Test status: run `bun test` in the worktree (if requested)
   - Merge readiness: all lower-tier worktrees merged?

4. Cross-reference with HexFlo task status:
```tool
mcp__hex__hex_hexflo_task_list()
```

## Action: merge

Merge worktrees in dependency order.

### Merge Order (ENFORCED)

```
Tier 0: domain → ports
Tier 1: secondary adapters (parallel within tier)
Tier 2: primary adapters (parallel within tier)
Tier 3: usecases
Tier 4: composition root
Tier 5: integration tests
```

### Steps

1. Verify merge preconditions for each worktree (hexa-merge-validation hook):
   - Tests pass in the worktree
   - All lower-tier worktrees already merged
   - No cross-adapter imports
   - Commit conventions followed

2. Merge in order:
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feat/<feature>/domain --no-ff -m "feat(domain): <feature> domain types"
git merge feat/<feature>/ports --no-ff -m "feat(ports): <feature> port contracts"
# ... secondary adapters ...
# ... primary adapters ...
git merge feat/<feature>/integration --no-ff -m "test(<feature>): integration tests"
```

3. After each merge, run the test suite:
```bash
bun run check && bun test
```

4. If conflicts arise:
   - Resolve manually (adapters should not conflict with each other)
   - Port/domain conflicts indicate a planning error — escalate to planner agent

5. If `scripts/feature-workflow.sh` exists:
```bash
./scripts/feature-workflow.sh merge <feature-name>
```

## Action: cleanup

Remove worktrees and branches after successful merge.

### Steps

1. Verify all worktrees are merged:
```bash
git branch --merged main | grep "feat/<feature>/"
```

2. Remove worktrees:
```bash
git worktree remove ../hexa-feat-<feature>-domain
git worktree remove ../hexa-feat-<feature>-ports
# ... all worktrees ...
```

3. Delete branches:
```bash
git branch -d feat/<feature>/domain
git branch -d feat/<feature>/ports
# ... all branches ...
```

4. Clean up HexFlo memory:
```tool
mcp__hex__hex_hexflo_memory_store({
  key: "feature/<feature>/worktrees",
  value: { status: "cleaned", cleaned_at: "ISO timestamp" }
})
```

5. If `scripts/feature-workflow.sh` exists:
```bash
./scripts/feature-workflow.sh cleanup <feature-name>
```

## Action: list

List all active feature worktrees across all features.

```bash
git worktree list
```

Group by feature name and show tier/status for each.

## Action: stale

Find abandoned worktrees (older than 24h with no new commits).

```bash
# List worktrees and check last commit date
for wt in $(git worktree list --porcelain | grep "^worktree" | cut -d' ' -f2); do
  last_commit=$(git -C "$wt" log -1 --format="%ci" 2>/dev/null)
  echo "$wt: $last_commit"
done
```

Flag worktrees with no commits in 24+ hours. Recommend cleanup or reassignment.

## Worktree Limits

- **Maximum 8 concurrent worktrees** per feature (matches max parallel agents)
- Worktrees are created in the parent directory of the project root (../hexa-feat-*)
- Each worktree gets a full copy of the repo — disk space scales linearly
