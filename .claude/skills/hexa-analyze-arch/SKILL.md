# Hex Analyze Arch — Architecture Health Check with Auto-Fix

Runs a full hexagonal architecture analysis. When violations are found, automatically creates HexFlo tasks and spawns a fix swarm — no manual triage needed.

## Parameters

- **rootPath** (optional, default: "."): Root directory to analyze
- **autoFix** (implicit: true when critical/high issues found): Spawn agents to fix violations
- **reportOnly** (optional, default: false): Skip auto-fix, just report

## Execution Steps

### 1. Run Architecture Analysis

Call the hexa_analyze MCP tool:

```
mcp__hex__hex_analyze({ path: rootPath })
```

This returns the formatted HEXAGONAL ARCHITECTURE HEALTH REPORT with:
- Summary table (files, exports, violations, circular deps, dead exports, repo hygiene)
- Error rates with thresholds
- Layer breakdown
- Boundary violations grouped by severity (CRITICAL/WARNING)
- Circular dependencies
- Dead exports grouped by file
- Unused ports & adapters
- **Repo hygiene (anti-slop)**: uncommitted files, staged-not-committed, orphan worktrees, embedded git repos, untracked build artifacts, runtime state dirs
- Health score and grade (A-F)

Display the full report to the user.

### 2. Extract Action Items

Use the action item extractor from the domain layer to convert findings into structured tasks:

Use the domain layer's action item extractor to convert findings into structured tasks:

```
actionReport = buildActionItemReport(archResult)
formatted = formatActionItems(actionReport)
```

Display the ACTION ITEMS report showing:
- MUST FIX: Critical and high-priority items with suggested fixes
- SHOULD FIX: Medium and low-priority items

### 3. Register Tasks in HexFlo

For each action item with priority `critical` or `high`, create a HexFlo task:

```
mcp__hex__hex_hexflo_task_create({
  title: item.title,
  metadata: {
    category: item.category,        // bug, violation, circular-dep
    priority: item.priority,        // critical, high
    file: item.file,                // affected file path
    layer: item.layer,              // hexa layer name
    suggestedFix: item.suggestedFix,
    source: "hexa-analyze-arch",
    autoFixable: item.autoFixable
  }
})
```

Store the full report in HexFlo memory:
```
mcp__hex__hex_hexflo_memory_store("devtracker/validation-actions", JSON.stringify(actionReport))
```

### 4. Auto-Fix Decision

If `reportOnly` is true, stop here with the report.

Otherwise, evaluate whether to auto-fix:

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Critical violations (cross-adapter, domain leak) | Spawn fix agent immediately |
| Circular dependencies | Spawn fix agent immediately |
| High-priority violations only | Spawn fix agent |
| Medium/low only (dead exports, unused ports) | Report only, do not auto-fix |
| Score >= 90 (Grade A) | No action needed |

### 5. Spawn Fix Swarm

For each fixable issue, spawn a targeted agent in a worktree:

```
Agent tool: {
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  mode: "bypassPermissions",
  run_in_background: true,
  isolation: "worktree",
  prompt: <fix prompt with full context>
}
```

#### Fix Prompts by Category

**Boundary Violation** (adapter imports from wrong layer):
```
Fix hexa boundary violation in {file}.
Current: imports {names} from {wrongLayer}
Required: import through ports layer only.

Check if the types are already re-exported through a port file.
If yes: change the import path to use the port.
If no: add re-exports to the appropriate port file, then update the import.

Rules:
- adapters/ may only import from ports/
- domain/ may only import from domain/
- usecases/ may only import from domain/ and ports/

After fixing, run the project's test suite.
```

**Circular Dependency**:
```
Break circular dependency: {cycle}

Strategies (pick the simplest):
1. Extract shared types to a common domain file both can import
2. Introduce a port interface to break the direct dependency
3. Use event-based decoupling if the cycle is behavioral

After fixing, run the project's test suite.
```

**Domain Leak** (domain imports non-domain):
```
Fix domain purity violation in {file}.
Domain layer must have zero external dependencies.
Move the imported types to domain/ or inject via port interface.

After fixing, run the project's test suite.
```

### 6. Monitor Fix Results

After spawning fix agents:

1. Wait for agent completion notifications
2. For each completed fix:
   - Run `mcp__hex__hex_validate_boundaries(".")` to verify the fix
   - If violation resolved: `mcp__hex__hex_hexflo_task_complete(taskId, commitHash)`
   - If still broken: report failure, do NOT retry automatically
3. Run final `mcp__hex__hex_analyze(".")` to get updated health score

### 7. Write Report

Write the full analysis + action items + fix results to `docs/analysis/arch-report.md`:

```markdown
# Architecture Health Report — {date}

## Score: {score}/100 ({grade})

## Summary
{summary table}

## Error Rates
{error rates table}

## Violations Found
{violations table with severity}

## Action Items Created
{list of HexFlo tasks created}

## Fixes Applied
{list of auto-fixed issues with commit hashes}

## Remaining Issues
{items that need manual attention}
```

### 8. Final Status

Display to the user:
- Before/after health score comparison
- Number of issues auto-fixed vs remaining
- Any items that need manual attention
- Link to the full report

## Exclude Patterns

The analyzer excludes these by default:
- `node_modules`, `dist`, `examples`
- `*.test.ts`, `*.spec.ts`, `*_test.go`, `*.test.rs`
- `/tests/`
- `**/target/**` (build artifacts)

## Output

- Full health report displayed inline
- Action items report displayed inline
- HexFlo tasks created for critical/high issues
- Fix agents spawned for violations (unless reportOnly)
- Report written to `docs/analysis/arch-report.md`
