//! Resource governor — memory-aware admission control (ADR-2606080915, Tier 0).
//!
//! The OOM that motivated this: a 29 GB model load + a compile-heavy job together
//! exceeded 30 GB RAM and the kernel killed unrelated processes. hexa had no memory
//! manager. This module is the pure decision core: given measured memory numbers,
//! decide whether a *local* workload fits — and if not, route it to the frontier
//! fallback (`claude -p`), which needs no local RAM, instead of OOMing.
//!
//! Pure and deterministic on purpose: the caller (a hexa-nexus adapter) supplies the
//! measured numbers (MemAvailable, model footprint, etc.); this crate stays dep-free
//! and unit-testable. See `tests/resource_governor_spec.rs` for the behavioral spec.
