//! `lib.rs` is the **composition root**: the only place allowed to name a
//! concrete adapter. Everything else depends on the port.

//! ```text
//!   domain  ←  ports  ←  usecases
//!                ↑
//!           adapters (secondary)
//!                ↑
//!        lib.rs — wires them, once
//! ```
