# Task Assignment Protocol

You are assigning workplan steps to HexFlo agents. Each step must become a concrete agent prompt that encodes everything the agent needs — no ambient knowledge assumed.

## Assignment Rules

1. **One step → one task** — never merge two workplan steps into a single HexFlo task
2. **Tier before assignment** — all tier N tasks must be created before any tier N+1 task is assigned
3. **Include task ID in prompt** — every agent prompt MUST begin with `HEXFLO_TASK:{task_id}` so the hook auto-tracks state
4. **Include worktree path** — agent must know its isolated worktree branch: `feat/{{feature_name}}/{layer_or_adapter}`
5. **End with explicit commit** — every agent prompt MUST end with `git add <files> && git commit -m "..."` — worktree agents do not auto-commit

## Prompt Template per Step

```
HEXFLO_TASK:{task_id}

You are a {agent_role} agent working in worktree: feat/{feature_name}/{layer_or_adapter}

## Task
{step.description}

## Files to create or modify
{step.files joined by newline}

## Acceptance Criteria
{step.acceptance_criteria as checklist}

## Depends on (already merged)
{step.depends_on joined by newline, or "none"}

## Architecture constraints
- Layer: {step.layer}
- MUST NOT import from: {forbidden_layers_for_this_layer}
- All relative imports use .js extensions

## When done
git add {step.files} && git commit -m "feat({feature_name}/{layer_or_adapter}): {step.title}"
```

## Agent Role Selection

| Layer | Agent Role |
|-------|-----------|
| domain | hexa-coder |
| ports | hexa-coder |
| adapters/secondary | hexa-coder |
| adapters/primary | hexa-coder |
| usecases | hexa-coder |
| composition-root | hexa-coder |
| tests (integration) | integrator |

## Forbidden Imports by Layer

| Layer | Forbidden imports |
|-------|------------------|
| domain | ports/, adapters/, usecases/, composition-root |
| ports | adapters/, usecases/, composition-root |
| usecases | adapters/, composition-root |
| adapters/secondary | adapters/primary, adapters/secondary (other), usecases, composition-root |
| adapters/primary | adapters/secondary, adapters/primary (other), usecases, composition-root |
| composition-root | — (can import everything, that is its purpose) |

## HexFlo Dispatch Sequence

```
1. swarm_init (once per feature)
2. For each step in tier order:
   a. task_create(swarm_id, title=step.title, description=step.description)
   b. Spawn Agent tool with mode=bypassPermissions + run_in_background=true
      Prompt must contain HEXFLO_TASK:{task_id}
3. Wait for tier N to complete before dispatching tier N+1
4. task_complete(task_id, result="commit hash + summary") after agent finishes
```

## Parallel Execution

Steps sharing the same tier number MAY run in parallel. Spawn them in a single message (multiple Agent tool calls). Do not start tier N+1 until ALL tier N tasks are complete.

## Assignment Output Format

```json
{
  "swarm_id": "<uuid>",
  "assignments": [
    {
      "step_id": "<step-id>",
      "task_id": "<hexflo-task-uuid>",
      "agent_role": "hexa-coder",
      "worktree": "feat/<feature-name>/<layer-or-adapter>",
      "tier": 0,
      "parallel_with": ["<step-id>", "..."]
    }
  ]
}
```
