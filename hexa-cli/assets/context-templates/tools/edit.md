Performs exact string replacements in files.

You MUST use the Read tool at least once in the conversation before editing. When editing text from Read tool output, preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix.

The edit will FAIL if old_string is not unique in the file. Either provide more surrounding context to make it unique, or use replace_all to change every instance.

## hexa-specific rules

### Always read before edit

This is not optional. Edit matches `old_string` byte-for-byte — if you haven't read the current file, you will mismatch indentation, miss recent changes, or corrupt the file.

### Uniqueness requirement

If `old_string` appears more than once, Edit will fail. Solutions:
1. Expand `old_string` to include more surrounding context (function signature, struct name, comment above)
2. Use `replace_all: true` if you intentionally want every occurrence changed (e.g., renaming a variable)

### Hexagonal architecture edit discipline

When editing an adapter, keep the edit within that adapter's boundary:
- Do NOT edit a port interface from inside an adapter file — open the port file separately
- Do NOT import other adapter modules while editing an adapter
- If your edit requires touching 2+ architectural layers, treat each as a separate Edit call

### Common edit targets in hexa projects

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
# Port trait/interface: add a new method signature
src/ports/<port_name>.rs          # Rust
src/core/ports/<port_name>.ts     # TypeScript

# Secondary adapter: implement a new method
src/adapters/secondary/<name>.rs  # Rust
src/adapters/secondary/<name>.ts  # TypeScript

# Primary adapter: update entry points
src/adapters/primary/<name>.rs    # Rust
src/adapters/primary/<name>.ts    # TypeScript

# Use cases: update application logic
src/usecases/<name>.rs            # Rust
src/core/usecases/<name>.ts       # TypeScript
```

### After editing source files

Verify the edit compiles before moving on: `cargo check -p <crate>` (Rust), `tsc --noEmit` (TypeScript), or equivalent for your language.
=======
# Port interface: add a new method signature
src/core/ports/<port-name>.ts    (or .rs for Rust projects)

# Secondary adapter: implement a new method
src/adapters/secondary/<adapter>.ts

# Primary adapter: add a new entry point
src/adapters/primary/<adapter>.ts

# Domain types: add a new value object
src/core/domain/value-objects.ts
```

### After editing code

Run your project's build check command to verify the edit compiles before moving on.
