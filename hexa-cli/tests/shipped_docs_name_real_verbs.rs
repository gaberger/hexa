Keep this. It is mine.

## hexa Autonomous Behavior (IMPORTANT)

1. **Enqueue work, don't defer it.** `hexa brain enqueue`.

## hexa Tool Precedence (IMPORTANT)

Use `mcp__hex__hex_plan_execute`.

## Hexagonal Architecture Rules (ENFORCED)

1. domain imports only domain.

## File Organization

```
src/
```

## Security

Keep this too. Also mine.
