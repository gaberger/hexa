//! ADR-2026-04-14-2201 Reconcile Evidence Verification — Regression Tests (R1.3)
//!
//! Verifies that `hexa plan reconcile` does NOT auto-promote tasks whose
//! target files are missing from the filesystem, even when other heuristic
//! signals (identifier grep, cargo check) might fire.
//!
//! Two scenarios:
//!   1. Partial workplan (wp-partial.json): P1 already done, P2/P3 pending
//!      with non-existent files → P2/P3 must stay "needs work".
//!   2. Fully-evidenced tasks: files exist in the repo → promotion works.
