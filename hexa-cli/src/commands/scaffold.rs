//! `hexa scaffold` — build a described project onto a proven hexagonal floor,
//! using the frontier path, and gate the result twice.
//!
//! # Why this verb exists
//!
//! There were two scaffolding stories and neither was a hexa verb that worked.
//!
//! `hexa init --scaffold` writes a deterministic skeleton: a manifest, a gate
//! command, four passing tests and a correct ports-and-adapters layout, the
//! same bytes every time. It is proven runnable by
//! `hexa-cli/tests/scaffold_is_executable.rs`. What it cannot do is build *your*
//! project — it emits a counter, in one of three languages.
//!
//! `/hexa-scaffold` was a 144-line Markdown prompt: an interactive wizard that
//! generated a bespoke project, TypeScript only, with no gate, no grade, and no
//! existence outside a Claude Code session. It told a model to "verify the app
//! works end-to-end" and had no way to check that it had.
//!
//! This verb is the two joined at the gate.
//!
//! # The shape
//!
//! 1. **Write the deterministic skeleton.** Every byte from an embedded
//!    template. No inference yet.
//! 2. **Run its gate before spending a model call.** If the floor is not green
//!    on this machine, nothing measured after it means anything — that is the
//!    2048 build's lesson, where a hand-written gate could not run at all
//!    because it needed a Node version this box does not have.
//! 3. **Build the description onto it** through `hexa_exec::adversarial`, whose
//!    every agent is a `claude -p` worker — the frontier path. Diverge,
//!    red-team, synthesize, build.
//! 4. **Re-run the gate independently.** The harness reports its own verdict;
//!    this checks it.
//! 5. **Gate on the architecture grade.** This is the step that makes the verb
//!    *hexagonal* scaffolding rather than code generation in a directory. A
//!    frontier model will happily produce a working program that imports a
//!    secondary adapter straight into a use case.
//!
//! Two gates, because they catch different failures. The language gate says the
//! thing runs. The architecture gate says it is the thing you asked for.
