//! `hexa build` and `hexa harden` — the cooperative + adversarial harness.
//!
//! Renamed from `hexa swarm build` / `hexa swarm review` (ADR-2608241500 P6.4).
//! The implementation in `hexa_exec::adversarial` is unchanged and is the
//! measured source of quality in this project: it built a ~2,900-LOC durable
//! job queue from a one-line spec, and its adversarial pass found six real
//! bugs the build's own passing tests missed.
//!
//! # Why the name changed and the code did not
//!
//! It is in-process fan-out of inference calls. There is no registry, no
//! heartbeat, no lease and no peer — nothing a "swarm" implies and nothing the
//! deleted coordination tier provided. The word was describing a cluster that
//! is not there. What it actually does is: propose several designs, attack
//! each, pick one, build it, then hunt the result for bugs.
//!
//! The rest of `hexa swarm` — `init`, `status`, `list`, `complete`, `fail`,
//! `cleanup`, `run` — was the fleet registry those verbs managed, kept in
//! SpacetimeDB behind the daemon. It went with them.
//!
//! # The gate is the only authority
//!
//! Both verbs take `--gate`, a shell command that must exit 0. Nothing here
//! decides a build is finished; the gate does.
